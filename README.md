###Model from "Diverse and complex muscle spindle afferent firing properties emerge from multiscale muscle mechanics"

This folder contains all the model code necessary to reproduce the simulations from our 2020 paper by Blum and colleagues published in eLife. 

To run your own simulations, it is recommended you begin with the 'example.m' script and change inputs to the model as desired. 

To reproduce the simulation figures from the eLife paper, use 'makeElifeFigs.m'. This script assumes there is a folder containing necessary simulation data, called 'manuscript_data' at the same level as the folder this script is in. These data can be found in the linked Dryad data repo. 

This is a static repository -- upon publication of the manuscript, no additional changes to this repo will be made, in order to preserve the published version of the model. Improvements and new features will be made available in a separate repository. 

Please reach out if you have questions! --KPB
